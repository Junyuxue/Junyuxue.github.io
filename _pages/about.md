Short Bio
------
<div class="justified">
I am an En.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (Joint training with Pengcheng Laboratory), under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=wangy37&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1">Prof. Yi Wang</a>. Before that, I received my B.E. in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from China University of Petroleum (East China), advised by <a href="https://computer.upc.edu.cn/2017/0313/c6289a103931/page.htm">Prof. Tao Song</a>. I was born and raised in Linyi, Shandong Province, China.

Research
------
<div class="justified">
Keywords: Computer Networks, Data Center Network, Green Computing <br>
My research interests include Computer Networks (especially Time-sensitive Network) and Internet of Things. I focus on the application of AI in these two areas, especially in data center network architecture and edge intelligence. I am also interested in the energy consumption in computing. <br>
In addition to academic issues, I also pay attention to the practical application of various technologies in the real world. I am actively exploring the combination of academic and engineering (they should not be confused).
