Short Bio
------
I am an En.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (Joint training with Pengcheng Laboratory), under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=wangy37&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1). Before that, I received my B.E. in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from China University of Petroleum (East China), advised by [Prof. Tao Song](https://computer.upc.edu.cn/2017/0313/c6289a103931/page.htm). I was born and raised in Linyi, Shandong Province, China.<br>

Research
------
My research interests include Computer Networks (especially Time-sensitive Network), Internet of Things and AI For Science. I also focus on the application of AI in the energy field, such as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). In addition to academic issues, I also pay attention to the practical application of various technologies in the real world. I am actively exploring the combination of academic and engineering (they should not be confused).
