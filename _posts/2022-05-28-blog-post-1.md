- 那些庞大的事物，有着宏大架构的精神世界，或则激人后退，而又巧施推手；或则催人向前，片刻不停。不妨摧毁它们，乌托邦随之崩溃。
- 该感到幸福的，是里厄医生的抗争和坚持，朴素的正直使光环加之于身，让大多数人感到敬佩；也是推动石块，这不是重要的。
- 半场雨，清洗寒风，送春入夏。难得的好征兆。
- 苦难让人沉眠，自然也会敲醒沉眠的人。强大的压抑让人囹圄中的人倍感踏实，天性是有活力的，抹杀之后再难复苏，荒诞感再不会在你的世界中出现；它也让不受拘束的人探出头来，此时诞生的可能是救世主，是土匪，是任何时代中存在的人物，仅仅受二字限制——青年。仅从短短的描写中便可见一斑。
- 绵绵头上飞花。
- 儒家，是乐感文化。切以自己的解读为标准，而非以封建一类尽数消灭，尽管某些人的观点也是难以否决的。
- 电子化的人类 / 扁平化的生活，让人反感。值得喜欢的应是（极）简化。
- 再见时，你我又将以何种面貌看见彼此。
- 发散→收拢 / 自由 / 端好 / … <br>

- Suffering makes people sleep, and naturally it will wake up the sleepy. Powerful repression makes people in prison feel practical, and the nature is dynamic, and it is difficult to recover after the elimination, and the absurd sense will no longer appear in your world; It also allows the unfettered to pop their heads out, and what may be born is a savior, a bandit, a figure of any age, limited by only two words - youth. Just from the short description can be seen.
- The flowers fly in my head.
- Confucianism is music culture. We should take our own interpretation as the standard, rather than abolish it all as feudalism, although some people's views are also difficult to reject.
- Electronic human/flat life, repulsive. The (extreme) simplicity is to be liked.
- In what form shall we see each other when we see each other again?
- Divergent → Gather/free/end well /...
